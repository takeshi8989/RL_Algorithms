# RL_Fundamental

## Theory
- Implementing the algorithms shown in RL textbook
  - DP
  - Monte Carlo
  - TD
  - Approximation with Neural Networks
  - ... (DRL, Q) etc


## Example Projects
- Easy
  - K-Armed Bandit
  - Gridworld
  - Blackjack
 
- Intermediate
  - CartPole Problem (OpenAI Gym)
  - Mountain Car Problem (OpenAI Gym)
  - etc

## Paper Analysis
- Read popular papers, summary, implement


# What's next?
Your own project
- Robotics
- Vision



# My Roadmap (By December 2024)
- Textbook by Sutton (Oct)
- OpenAI Spinning up (Oct)
- Implement RL Algorithms (While reading the textbook again --> Deep understanding) (Nov)
- Easy Projects (Nov)
- Read Papers (Write about them, implement the theory) (Nov)
- An Introduction to Deep Reinforcement Learning (Dec)
- Paper Reading (Dec)

Then, go further and deeper (April 2025)
- Read more specific papers
- Big Personal Project ~3 months of hard work (With Robotics, new, no one has done)
- Do something other than RL (RL is just one of the methods to make a robot move smoothly, Explore more)
